Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With a small amount of simulations, the Netherlands seems to have a higher percentage of winning. When you increase the number of simulations, the percentage of The Netherlands drops quickly.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After about 10.000 simulations, the predictions seems to stabilize.
