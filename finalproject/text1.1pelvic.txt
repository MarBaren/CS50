There is no one defining cause of a hypertonic pelvic floor; however, there are several activities which can lead to the muscles tightening up. As an example, many people who spend a lot of time working out and holding onto their core muscles can develop tension in their pelvic floor because they keep these muscles switched ‘on’ without giving the muscles times to relax and let go.

People who have a history of holding on to their bladder and/or bowels can also develop tension in their pelvic floor muscles. For instance, some people feel uncomfortable using public toilets so may hold on to their bladders for hours until they come back home from school, work or social activities. The act of holding on means the pelvic floor muscles are tightening to prevent the loss of control.

As high levels of stress, fear or anxiety can cause muscles to reflexively tighten, these factors can lead to a hypertonic pelvic floor. Consider how a puppy behaves when it is afraid—it runs away with its tail between its legs. Similarly, humans have a primitive response during fight or flight where the tailbone tucks under. The pelvic floor muscles are attached to the tailbone and this causes the muscles to shorten.
