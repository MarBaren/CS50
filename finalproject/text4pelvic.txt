If you have any of the signs or symptoms of a hypertonic pelvic floor, or you have a client that communicates any of these signs or symptoms, seeing a continence physiotherapist is essential. The physiotherapist will be able to identify the root cause of the hypertonicity and provide tools to help  overcome this.

A continence physiotherapy session may involve a combination of the following:

- pelvic floor muscle relaxation techniques
- breathing techniques
- advice on bladder and bowel habits
- pelvic floor and abdominal massage techniques
- the use of vaginal dilators for women, to stretch the pelvic floor muscles
- pelvic and hip stretches, and
- scar tissue massage techniques.
