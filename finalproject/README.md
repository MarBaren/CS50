**PELVIS**

In the final year of my HBO education, I conducted an in-depth study on pelvic floor muscle tension, leading to the conceptualization of the PELVIS app. 
This app is designed specifically for women experiencing elevated pelvic floor muscle tension. 
Currently, I am actively working on translating this concept into a functional website using Flask, with a specific emphasis on developing back-end functionalities.

The ongoing development of the PELVIS website aims to provide users with a secure and personalized experience. 
I am implementing features to ensure that all user data is securely stored in an SQL database, and a secure login system has been integrated to safeguard user privacy.

A distinctive aspect of the website is its user-friendly interface, allowing users to explore various topics such as articles, yoga video exercises, and physiotherapy routines. 
It will include a favorites system linked to the user, enabling the storage of personal preferences and easy access to favorite content.

A prominent feature within the project is the stress meter, allowing users to record their stress levels up to five times a day. 
These data are currently being implemented and will be stored in the database, including timestamps, visible on both the homepage and a dedicated stress meter page. 
Further expansion involves presenting an overview of the past period and the most prevalent emotions recorded by the stress meter.

The project also encompasses detailed storage of user-performed exercises, including timestamps, creating an activity log. 
This information is currently being integrated into the database and will be accessible to the user in a structured overview.
