I was diagnosed with Endometriosis ten years ago and due the number of operations I have had to remove Endometriosis, I developed residual nerve damage. After fully exhausting all available treatment options in the UK, I went to see a specialist team of pelvic pain doctors at the Hôtel-Dieu Nantes, France.

The specialist team of doctors that saw me in France over the course of two days were amazing! On day one of my visit to the hospital I spent time with a French Doctor, whose vast experience in the field was beyond impressive. He gave me an extensive physical examination, after reviewing my medical history and to my complete surprise… he was able to suggest a diagnosis immediately! I was diagnosed with Maigne Syndrome (Thoracolumbar Junction Syndrome) – it affects the nerves in my back that divert the pain down to my lower back and forward to my pelvis. Following a further examination by a team of eight French doctors, in a multi-disciplinary appointment the following day, this diagnosis was re-confirmed. The team of doctors recommended I saw a Chiropractor in the UK and if the pain did not subside, then I was able to return to Nantes and receive a nerve block in my spine, which is not available in the UK.

Due to the fact I also suffered with Endometriosis, the doctors in the multi-disciplinary appointment requested I return to Nantes for an MRI to determine if I had any active Endometriosis. As MRI’s are not used in the UK for detecting Endometriosis, it was incredible to be able to see what stage my Endometriosis was at, without having to have yet another investigative laparoscopy in the UK. Without the opportunity to receive treatment in France, I would still be in extreme debilitating pain.Even with the language barrier the doctors were incredible and made me feel extremely comfortable, I cannot speak highly enough of them! I hope this level of treatment is made available to more patients.
