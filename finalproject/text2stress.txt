An overactive, or hypertonic, pelvic floor occurs when our pelvic floor muscles cannot fully relax. There are tons of reasons why this happens, including chronic stress!

Hypertonic pelvic floor symptoms include:
- Painful sex
- Painful sitting
- Painful abdominal muscles
- Problems pooping and peeing
