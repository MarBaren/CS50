Pelvic health and abdominal health conditions can also result in hypertonicity of the pelvic floor. For example, many women with endometriosis can develop tense pelvic floor muscles due to the chronic pain and inflammation in the pelvis. Similarly, a history of irritable bowel syndrome with abdominal pain and cramping can result in pelvic floor muscle pain and cramping. Other conditions linked to a hypertonic pelvic floor include interstitial cystitis, pudendal neuralgia and vulvodynia.

Birth trauma and scar tissue is another cause of tightness in the pelvic floor muscles. Women who experience perineal tearing or vaginal tearing may be at a higher risk, as the pain and scarring can cause the pelvic floor muscles to tighten protectively. One-sided pelvic floor tears can cause the opposite side of the pelvic floor to tighten due to overactivity.

It is crucial to identify the cause of the pelvic floor hypertonicity in each individual. A continence  physiotherapist will be best equipped to do this.
