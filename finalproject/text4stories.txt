The pain first started in 2000 and that was when I realised that something was wrong. I had a cycle of suffering from urine infections and thrush that never seemed to go away.

Whilst I was on holiday in New York I suffered a particularly bad urine infection and had lots of blood in my urine. I was rushed to the Emergency Room and given a strong antibiotic called ciprofloxacin. It really helped with the symptoms and the pain.

Back in the UK I was referred to a urologist who diagnosed me with interstitial cystitis. I was now suffering with constant pelvic pain and was shocked to hear there was not a lot they could do to help me.

I went on to see other gynaecologists, urogynaecologists and other urologists to get a different opinion as I couldn’t accept that this was something I just had to live with. I had a laparoscopy which didn’t spot anything and being so fed up I decided to also seek private medical treatment and underwent video urodynamics, an X-ray examination of the bladder. Again this didn’t come up with any obvious problem.

Certain things have helped such as avoiding wheat and gluten, avoiding caffeine, exercise, pilates and doing pelvic floor exercises. I am now on medication which is making sleeping easier at night however I still have constant pain and an overactive bladder which means I can go to the loo around 15 times a day.

The condition has severely affected my life and my marriage, in particular the physical aspect of my relationship. I feel like the condition has deprived me of my 30s and I am determined to keep pushing for further new treatments and ways to ensure my life isn’t further affected by it.
