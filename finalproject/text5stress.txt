When we experience constant stress, our systems release cortisol repeatedly. This stress hormone tends to stick around for hours after the stressor. Eventually, our bodies simply canâ€™t make any more cortisol. This state of exhaustion creates more problems, like lower immune response, poor sleep, and pain.

Our HPA axis can become too active when we experience long-term stress. This stress can come from trauma, abuse, lack of sleep, hormonal changes, or managing a chronic illness. This means it could start responding to non-stressors as if they were stressors. And that creates a constant cortisol-producing-and-exhaustion cycle.

People often overlook this mind-body connection. So to truly treat pelvic floor tension and pain, we need to think more holistically.
