Epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine can contribute to pelvic pain. These hormones work together to increase blood flow in stressful situations. This causes our muscles to enter fight-or-flight mode— aka they tense up.

And when we’re constantly under pressure, our muscles are never able to fully relax.

Both epinephrine and norepinephrine tend to enter and leave our systems quickly. However, when your stress or anxiety is a chronic concern, cortisol might be to blame for pelvic pain.
