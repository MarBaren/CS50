#1 Address the stress.
Decreasing chronic stress and pelvic floor tension can be done together. The less stressed we feel, the more our muscles can relax! From practicing yoga to seeing a professional therapist, making small changes over time can help decrease toxic stress.

#2 Pause on Kegels.
Kegels and other tightening exercises can make matters worse. We need to use relaxation techniques before we can appropriately strengthen our pelvic floor muscles. So, stop the cookie-cutter Kegels to take the pressure off your pelvic floor.

#3 Practice diaphragmatic breathing.
Sometimes we just need to take a breath. Lie on your back with your knees bent.

Put one hand on each side of your rib cage. Deeply inhale, inflating your ribcage, as if it’s opening up like an umbrella, then slowly exhale. Allow one breath to flow smoothly to the next and repeat for 10-20 breaths.

#4 Use lots of lube.
Lube improves sex, reduces friction, sensitivity, and pain during sexual activity. Use a water-soluble lubricant or natural oil—like coconut oil—during intercourse and feel the difference. Or, try a CBD-based product. Your downstairs will thank you!

#6 Try vaginal dilators.
To start relaxing your pelvic floor, particularly before sex, tampon insertion, or a pelvic examination, try a little stretch. Vaginal dilators look like a set of tampons of increasingly larger diameter. Putting these inside the vagina can reduce sensitivity, calm muscles, and make scar tissue at the vaginal opening softer.

#7 Perform pelvic floor massage.
A Therawand is a useful tool for relieving pelvic floor tension. It’s a tool with a curved tip that applies pressure to tight muscles, helping them relax. You can use this tool in the deeper pelvic floor muscles or at the opening to soften pelvic floor muscles or any scar tissue.

#8 Poop and pee the right way.
Did you even know there was a right way to go to the bathroom? To help you pee more effectively:
- Sip water throughout the day to prevent concentrated urine from irritating your bladder.
- Avoid drinking fluids two hours before bed to eliminate frequent nighttime wakeups.
- Decrease your consumption of alcohol, coffee, carbonated drinks, and spicy or acidic foods to help urinary urgency.
- Avoid hovering over the toilet, which clenches your pelvic muscles and prevents complete bladder emptying.
- Skip those “just in case” pees. They can cause your bladder to shrink and increase urgency over time.
- Avoid waiting too long to pee, which can overstretch your bladder.
- Stop “power peeing,” as straining and pushing weakens your muscles.
- Sit down, relax, and breathe when you pee!

And for pooping:
- Avoid dairy and spicy and greasy foods, which make poop too soft.
- Eat plenty of fruits and veggies for their fiber and magnesium.
- Use a squatty potty or stool under your feet and lean forward to put your pelvic floor muscles in prime pooping position.
- Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate to decrease constipation.
- Exercise often to keep things moving.
- Always poop when you have the urge to poop, as delaying leads to straining when you do decide to go.
